  "description": "NOTE: THIS IS THE EXACT COPY OF BETTER-DISCORD-ANTISPAM BUT I FIXED  GRAMMAR ISSUES AND ADDED A FEATURE THAT DELETES THE MESSAGES THE USER SENDS AND THE ONE THE BOT SENDS FULL CREDIT GOES TO SENKO, A simple module based on Michale Scofield's module: discord-anti-spam.js! While containing the same features(quick and simple setup), it adds new things like setting up a report channel, timed mutes(removed ban option and added mute & unmute automatically) and many more features are coming on the way(probably adding that ban option back later...)!",
